Applications
============

An *application* in the Keyclic service limits the resources to a single domain.
It means the use of specific clients app or website.
For the eponymous client of the service, the *application* is "com.keyclic.app". Every client app and website using the key will share the same partition.
(Here: the iPhone app Keyclic, the Android app Keyclic and the website https://app.keyclic.com)

Other *applications* exist in the Keyclic service with different keys, it's the case of "Vinci Mon Autoroute" available on iPhone and Android.

For example, from "Vinci Mon Autoroute":

 - it is impossible to "send" a feedback sent to this *application* with the key "com.keyclic.app" and vice-versa,

 - it is impossible to list feedbacks sent to the *application* with the key "com.keyclic.app" and vice-versa.
